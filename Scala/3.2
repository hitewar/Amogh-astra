Collection -> List
-Sequence of more than one element
-Singly Linked list [1][]-->[2][]-->[3][]
-Invoked by apply method
-All lists end with an instance of Nil as their terminus.

Ex: 
val aList = List("Hydrogen","Helium","Lithium")
means : List.apply("Hydrogen","Helium","Lithium")

aList(1) ~= aList.apply()
